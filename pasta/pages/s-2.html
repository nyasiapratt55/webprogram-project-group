          <h1>Step 2: Making Meat Sauce</h1>
          <div class="recipe">
            <p>Stir in minced garlic and saut√© for a few more minutes. Add ground beef and dried oregano.<br><br>
              Cook the meat and use a wooden spoon to break it into smaller pieces. When meat pieces are browned, stir in the tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes.<br><br>
              Cover the sauce pot for 30-60 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
              When the sauce is done cooking, add the chopped basil and stir. Add salt and pepper as needed. Add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar if the sauce is too acidic for your taste.
